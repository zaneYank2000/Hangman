Open project in IDE (we used Intellij Ultimate)
Run server file
Run two clients
We did this by running project in IDE and then in the running window, copying and pasting the long command (that is run), and paste it into another terminal
Login or sign up in the two clients
One person selects "Host Game", while the other will select "Join Game"
Person who joined game is the guest and is the only one who is allowed to guess
Game will go on until one of the users win or lose
